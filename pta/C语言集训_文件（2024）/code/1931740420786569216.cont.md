A Cure for a Headache

One day a man went into a chemist's shop and said, "Have you anything to cure a
headache?"
The chemist took a bottle from a shelf,  held it under the gentleman's nose and
took out the cork.  The smell was so strong that tears came into the man's eyes
and ran down his cheeks.
"What did you do that for?"  he said angrily,  as soon as he could get back his
breath.
"But that medicine has cured your headache, hasn't it?" said the chemist.
"You fool," said the man, "It's my wife that has the headache, not me!"
